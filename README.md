# Ed&Dragons 5e Character Sheet
I find that current character management software (i.e ddb) is not that intuitively designed - at least not for me. I think a lot of regularly accessed information can be grouped together in much neater ways, and a sheet could be navigated in a more logical manner. The intention of this project is to create a fully interactable, db stored character sheet - with access to most available 5e materials (making the most of that creative commons licensing). This sheet would be printable in a condensed single page format for everything except spells and itinerary. It's a work in progress, hopefully it gets finished before 5e is suseded by a more popular RPG system!
